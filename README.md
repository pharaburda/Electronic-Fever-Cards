# Electronic-Fever-Cards
Project for academic course "Telemedicine systems" held on Warsaw University of Technology. 

This application has two user profiles, a nurse profile and a doctor profile. When registering, a new user enters his personal data, e-mail address, password and selects a user profile - doctor, nurse.
After registration, the application goes to the login screen.
After logging in to the doctor's profile, it is possible to perform two actions. The first is to add a new patient. To do this, enter the patient's data and then scan the patient using the NFC tag. Thanks to this, a new patient will be assigned to a specific marker. 
The second option is to enter the measurement history, which opens a screen with a list of all saved patients along with their temperature measurements.
After logging in to the nurse's profile, it is also possible to perform two activities. The first is to add a temperature measurement and assign it to a specific patient. Once added, it will be saved in the database. 
The second option is to view the measurement history of a specific patient by reading his NFC tag.
You can easily log out of each of the doctor and nurse user profiles. The logout option is in the main panel of both the nurse and the doctor. This brings you back to the login options as well as registration.
